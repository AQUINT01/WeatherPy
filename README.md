# WeatherPy 

## Overview
In this exercise, we are instructed to make a few changes to the PlanMyTrip app to take it to the next level. We are to add weather descriptions to the weather data provided in the module. The upgrades are to include input statements to filter data for weather preferences for potential travel destinations and nearby hotels; a travel itinerary for four cities; and lastly, use Google Maps Directions API to create a travel route between four cities with a marker layer map.




## Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data
From a set of **2,000** random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. 




## Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
Use input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences, then use those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Illustrate desired destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers.
